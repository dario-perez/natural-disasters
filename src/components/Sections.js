				<h1>Volcanoes</h1>
				<p>
					Volcanoes can produce ash, toxic gases, flash floods of hot water and debris called lahars, lava
					flows, and fast-moving flows of hot gases and debris called pyroclastic flows. Some dangers from
					volcanoes can be predicted ahead of time while others may occur with little or no notice after an
					eruption. Each volcano and situation is unique. Learn more about volcanic eruptions and pay
					attention to warnings from local authorities for the best advice available on specific actions you
					can take to stay safe.

				<h1>Tornadoes</h1>
				<p>
					Knowing what to do when you see a tornado, or when you hear a tornado warning, can help protect you
					and your family. During a tornado, people face hazards from extremely high winds and risk being
					struck by flying and falling objects. After a tornado, the wreckage left behind poses additional
					injury risks. Although nothing can be done to prevent tornadoes, there are actions you can take for
					your health and safety.

				<h1>Wildfire</h1>
				<p>
					More and more people make their homes in areas that are prone to wildfires. You can take steps to be
					ready for a wildfire and prepare your home and landscaping to reduce your risk. Learn how to protect
					yourself and your family from a wildfire, evacuate safely during a wildfire, and how to stay healthy
					when you return home.
